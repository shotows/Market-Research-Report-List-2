<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wavemeter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Michelson Interferometer-Based</li><li>Fizeau Interferometer-Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wavemeters are devices used to measure the wavelength of light. There are two main types of wavemeters: Michelson Interferometer-Based and Fizeau Interferometer-Based. Michelson interferometer-based wavemeters use a beamsplitter to split light into two beams and recombine them to produce interference patterns, allowing for wavelength measurement. Fizeau interferometer-based wavemeters use a partially reflective mirror to create interference patterns for wavelength measurement. Both types of wavemeters are commonly used in scientific research, telecommunications, and optical testing applications.</p></p>
