<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Grounding Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar</li><li>Bipolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Grounding pads are essential components in electrosurgical procedures to safely disperse electrical energy and prevent burns to surrounding tissues. Monopolar grounding pads have a single electrode and are used for procedures where the electrical current passes through the patient's body to a dispersive electrode. On the other hand, bipolar grounding pads have two electrodes and are used in procedures where the electrical current remains localized between the two electrodes, reducing the risk of unintended tissue damage. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring patient safety during surgical procedures.</p></p>
