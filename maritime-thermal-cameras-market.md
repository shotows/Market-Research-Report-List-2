<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Maritime Thermal Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uncooled Type</li><li>Cooled Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Maritime thermal cameras are divided into two main types: uncooled and cooled. Uncooled thermal cameras are more affordable and require less maintenance, making them ideal for smaller vessels or budget-conscious buyers. Cooled thermal cameras, on the other hand, offer higher resolution and sensitivity, making them suitable for larger vessels or applications where image clarity is critical. Both types of cameras use infrared technology to detect objects in the water or navigate in low visibility conditions, enhancing safety and security on board.</p></p>
