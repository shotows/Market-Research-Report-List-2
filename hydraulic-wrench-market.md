<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Wrench Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drive Hydraulic Torque Wrench</li><li>Hollow Hydraulic Torque Wrench</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydraulic wrenches are widely used in industrial applications for tightening and loosening bolts and nuts. Two common types of hydraulic wrenches are Drive Hydraulic Torque Wrench and Hollow Hydraulic Torque Wrench. Drive Hydraulic Torque Wrenches are used in situations where access to the nut or bolt is limited, as they have a compact design. Hollow Hydraulic Torque Wrenches are used when working with long bolts or studs, as they allow the bolt to pass through the center of the tool. Both types offer high torque capabilities and precision tightening.</p></p>
