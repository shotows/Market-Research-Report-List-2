<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicon Carbide Schottky Diodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SMD</li><li>Through Hole</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Silicon Carbide Schottky Diodes are available in two types - SMD (Surface Mount Device) and Through Hole. SMD diodes are smaller in size and are mounted directly onto the surface of a printed circuit board, making them ideal for compact electronic devices. On the other hand, Through Hole diodes have leads that are inserted through holes on the circuit board and then soldered in place. This type of diode is more commonly used in applications where high power handling and reliability are required.</p></p>
