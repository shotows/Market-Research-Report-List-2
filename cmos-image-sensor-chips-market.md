<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMOS Image Sensor Chips Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front-illuminated</li><li>Backside-illuminated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CMOS image sensor chips are available in two main market types: front-illuminated and backside-illuminated. Front-illuminated sensors have a traditional design where light enters through the front of the chip and passes through various layers before reaching the pixels. On the other hand, backside-illuminated sensors have a more advanced design where light enters through the back of the chip, allowing for better sensitivity and lower noise levels. Both types cater to different needs and preferences in the imaging technology industry.</p></p>
